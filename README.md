# TensorFlow_Udacity_Assignments
Udacity Deep Learning course using TensorFlow  - my attempt to solve the exercises

**Assignment 1** - Max Accuracy: 89.7% (using random trees)

**Assignment 2** - Max Accuracy: 88.8% (using 1-hidden layer neural network with rectified linear unit and 1024 hidden nodes)

**Assignment 3** - Max Accuracy: 95.0% (using a 2-hidden layer neural network)

**Assignment 4** - Max Accuracy: 92.7%  (two convolutional layers + one fully connected layer)
